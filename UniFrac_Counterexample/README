Core Script: 
max_vs_med_plot.R
	- Plots the Max Absolute Deviation vs Median Absolute Deviation between 2 rarefactions (or dirichlet instances)
	- Useful to visualize the amount of change in the shape of data after subsampling procedures

	- The calculation being performed is:
	
	Vres = |Vref - Vi| / max.range({V})

		Vres = resultant vector containing relative deviation
		Vref = refrence vector (usually PC1 of each analysis)
		Vi = each additional PC1 from each rarefaction/dirichlet instance
		{V} = set of ALL the PC1's for each analysis

	- Resulting Plot is a representation of how subsampling affects each analysis



Ancillary Scripts:
generate_aitchison_data.R
	- Expects a tab-delimited OTU table in the following format:
	- Outputs different Dirichlet instances for each sample for plotting
	
	sampl1	sampl2	sampl3	...	sampln
	OTU1	0	0	0	0	0
	OTU2	0	0	0	0	0
	OTU3	0	0	0	0	0
	...	0	0	0	0	0
	OTUn	0	0	0	0	0
